# WhichTwitch2
Which Twitch is a React web application that allows you to watch  up to four of your favorite live streamers at the same time, in the same window! Twitch users can connect their accounts to save their layout and come back to it later with the click of a button. If you don’t want to connect your account you can still take advantage of this feature by using the layouts from the “Popular” section. A remake of the original starting with Auth0's login boilerplate.
